## Technical Architecture

### AI Model Structure
```javascript
// Core AI Engine
class FinancialAIEngine {
    constructor() {
        this.models = {
            categorization: new TransactionCategorizer(),
            prediction: new SpendingPredictor(),
            anomaly: new AnomalyDetector(),
            recommendation: new RecommendationEngine()
        };
    }
}

// Real-time processing
class RealTimeProcessor {
    constructor() {
        this.streamProcessor = new StreamProcessor();
        this.eventBus = new EventEmitter();
    }
}
```

### Data Pipeline
1. **Ingestion**: Real-time transaction processing
2. **Preprocessing**: Data cleaning and normalization
3. **Feature Engineering**: Extract meaningful features
4. **Model Inference**: Run predictions
5. **Post-processing**: Format results for UI
6. **Caching**: Store results for quick access

## Success Metrics

### Accuracy Targets
- Transaction categorization: >95%
- Spending predictions: <10% error rate
- Anomaly detection: <5% false positives
- Recommendation relevance: >80% user acceptance

### Performance Targets
- Response time: <100ms for predictions
- Model loading: <2 seconds
- UI updates: <16ms (60fps)
- Memory usage: <50MB additional

## Risk Mitigation

### Privacy Concerns
- All processing happens locally
- No personal data sent to servers
- Transparent data usage policies
- User control over all AI features

### Accuracy Issues
- Human-in-the-loop validation
- Continuous model improvement
- Fallback to rule-based systems
- User feedback integration

### Performance Bottlenecks
- Progressive enhancement approach
- Lazy loading of AI models
- Efficient caching strategies
- Web Workers for heavy computation

## Next Steps

1. **Week 1**: Implement core AI categorization and basic predictions
2. **Week 2**: Add advanced visualizations and smart insights
3. **Week 3**: Integrate natural language processing
4. **Week 4**: Deploy ML models and personalization
