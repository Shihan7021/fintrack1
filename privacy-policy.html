        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 31, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to MindPay ("we," "us," "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your personal data in an open and transparent manner. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and protect your information when you use our website, services, and tools (collectively, our "Service").</p>
        <p>This policy applies to all users worldwide. By using our Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect information to provide and improve our Service to you. The types of information we collect can be broken down into two main categories:</p>
